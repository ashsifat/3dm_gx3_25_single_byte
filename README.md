# ROS Data Acquisition Driver for 3DM-GX3-25 IMU module (Single Byte Protocol)

This program is from Nathan Michael's original ROS driver for the Lord Corporation Microstrain 3DM GX3 25 IMU (https://github.com/KumarRobotics/imu_3dm_gx3) and is revised for attitude estimation using AQUA complementary filter (https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools).
